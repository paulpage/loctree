# LocTree

There are various tools that count the lines of code in a project, such as cloc or tokei. I'll use tools like this to get a very rough idea of the scope and complexity of a project. Where I've found these tools to fall short is when I want to get a deeper understanding of the shape of a codebase and answer questions such as which subsystems have the most code, or which languages are more prevelant in which areas. LocTree provides an interactive tree view of a codebase, allowing you to easily see line of code counts for every subdirectory of a project and filter it by language.
